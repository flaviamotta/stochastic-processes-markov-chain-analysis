# stochastic-processes-markov-chain-analysis
This repository contains R code for the analysis of Markov chains within the context of stochastic processes. The code performs simulations, constructs couplings, and investigates convergence properties of the Markov chain. It includes functions for initialization, state updating, empirical distribution estimation, and visualization of the simulated chains.
